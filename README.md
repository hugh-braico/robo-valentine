# Robo-Valentine ðŸ’‰

[![icons](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,ts,discordjs,gcp,aws)](https://skillicons.dev)

Discord bot for quickly getting Skullgirls frame data. 100% blind rewrite and
hopeful successor to Liam's Robo-Fortune bot (aka FDBot).

Written in TypeScript with discord.js. Currently hosted on Amazon Lightsail.

## How to add to your server

Robo-Valentine is a public bot, so you no longer need to contact a maintainer to
have it added to your server. Just click this funny magic link and you can add
the bot to any server that you're an admin of.

*Auth link:* <https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1374926026668249168&permissions=274877910016&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands>

## How to use the bot

`/fd` is a Discord slash command with two parameters (`character` and `move`),
e.g.

```plaintext
/fd character:Filia move:5LP
```

The above should yield the frame data for Filia's 5LP:

## Where is the data hosted?

Currently hosted as a Google sheet -
[Read-only link to bot data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WinMvGxS65707Uh2C0-VmDwXVTdav-DEI29j4OyJWXw/edit?usp=sharing).
If you want edit access, contact SeaJay.

If you're reading this in the future and the link above is dead, there are Excel
backups available in the `backups/` folder in this repository. You can download
one of those and upload it as a new Google Sheet, then point your bot towards
that (see "Using your own Google Sheet" below). I also encourage you to make
your own offline backups of the current live version.

## Loading new data into the bot

When pulling data for a `/fd` query, Robo-Valentine pulls from a local cache
held in a sqlite database instead of pulling from the Google Sheet every time.
This is mainly for performance reasons, and to avoid overuse of the Sheets API.
This also means data needs to be loaded from the Sheet to the cache.

Robo-Valentine uses the `/download` slash command to download new data from the
Google Sheet and load it into the bot's local cache for quick retrieval. If
you're an approved maintainer (contact SeaJay), you can use the command in
Discord to fetch new data.

## Dev setup

You'll need git, NodeJS, and npm. I'm using node `24.1.0`, so try to use the
same version especially if you're encountering any weird errors.

```shell
# clone the respository
git clone https://github.com/hugh-braico/robo-valentine.git
cd robo-valentine

# install Node dependencies
npm i

# copy the template config file to make the real file
cp config/config.json.template config/config.json
```

Make a new bot application in Discord's developer portal (there are many guides
online for this). Open `config/config.json` and fill in the token and Client ID
for your bot. Go through the oauth flow on one of your servers to add the bot,
so you have a channel to test commands with.

Add your own Discord user account's ID to the `approved-maintainers` array in
`config/config.json`. This just lets your user account call the `/download`
command.

You can optionally fill in the `activity-channel-id` with the ID of a channel
that Robo-Valentine has access to, and it will dump activity messages there.
Same for the `error-channel-id` which will get dumps with exceptions/errors.

Create a Google service account to authenticate against Sheets - follow
[this guide](https://theoephraim.github.io/node-google-spreadsheet/#/guides/authentication).

Place the JSON service account credentials file into
`config/service-account.json`.

Ask SeaJay to grant Viewer permissions to your service account (you will need
to supply the email address of the account). See the next section if you want
to set up your own Sheet.

Register all available slash commands with Discord on all servers:

```shell
npm run deploy-commands
```

Run the bot:

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Production setup

For production hosting, keep in mind that the database is less than 1 MB and
all the bot really does is present it in a user friendly way. The smallest
Lightsail or Heroku instance (etc) is perfectly fine.

The host I'm using at the moment is the smallest Amazon Lightsail instance -
512MB RAM, 2 vCPU, 20GB SSD, and the Bitnami Node.js prebuilt image.

To run a persistent session on a hosted server, where you want the process to
continue after you close the session:

```shell
# (follow instructions in "Dev setup" to clone repo, set up credentials)

# install dependencies
npm ci

# install PM2 globally (only do this once)
npm i pm2 -g

# start pm2-managed instance
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

Then later you can check on it with

```shell
# shows a list of running services
pm2 ls

# brings up the PM2 monitoring tool
pm2 monit
```

More destructive commands:

```shell
# restart the service eg. to introduce code changes
pm2 restart all

# kill the service
pm2 delete all
```

## Using your own Google Sheet

1. Go through the same process as above to create a service account and save it
   to the same `config/service-account.json` path.
1. Create your own Google Sheet under your own account (use the "Make a copy"
   feature, or upload one of the backup Excel files in `backups/`).
1. Replace the `google-sheet-id` in `config/config.json` with the ID of your new
   Sheet.
1. Share your new Sheet with your service account's email address (give it
   Viewer permissions).

After that, your instance of the bot should be able to download new data using
the `/download` slash command.

## TODO list

Robo-Val is mostly functional now, but could use a few finishing touches:

### Hosting/stability

- Add health checks
- Validate config on startup and throw up errors/warnings

### Code hygiene

- Clean up `any` and missing types
- Unit tests on relevant functions
