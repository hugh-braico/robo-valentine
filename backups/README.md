# Data backups

Copies of the frame data Google Sheet in xlsx format. Dated with YYYY-MM-DD.

## 2025-06-07

A copy of the Liam-style fdbot sheet before it was separated into character
sheets. Completely incompatible with current version of Robo-Valentine, but
included for posterity.

## 2025-06-08

First separation into character sheets.

## 2025-06-09

Added regex aliases to Umbrella.

## 2025-06-15

Minor changes, but this is the last backup before I let other maintainers loose
on the sheet.
